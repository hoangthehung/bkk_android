A little under a year ago, now, I committed to making an Android version of Chris Schepman's awesome Baby Ketten Karaoke iphone app (https://github.com/cschep/bkk).  Life then happened, and continues to happen, so I have made no headway, but I figured I will create the github presence to haunt and nag me as it will.
